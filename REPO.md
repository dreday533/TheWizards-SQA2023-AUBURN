After engaging in the specified activities, our team gained valuable insights into enhancing the security, robustness, and forensic capabilities of our Python project. 
The implementation of a Git Hook marked a significant stride in fortifying the project against potential security vulnerabilities. 
By configuring the Git Hook to run and report security weaknesses in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed, we established a proactive measure to identify and address security issues at an early stage of development. 
This automated security check not only saves time but also ensures a more resilient codebase.

The creation of the fuzz.py file was a crucial step towards bolstering the project's reliability. 
Fuzz testing, executed automatically through GitHub actions, allowed us to systematically probe and uncover potential bugs within five selected Python methods. 
This approach not only aids in identifying vulnerabilities but also streamlines the bug-fixing process, promoting a more stable and secure software development lifecycle.

Incorporating forensics into the project by modifying five chosen Python methods was a strategic move to enhance our understanding of potential post-incident analysis. 
This modification allows us to gather relevant forensic data during the execution of these methods, aiding in the investigation and resolution of any unexpected issues. 
Integrating forensics into the development process ensures that we are better equipped to identify, analyze, and respond to incidents, contributing to the overall resilience of our software.
